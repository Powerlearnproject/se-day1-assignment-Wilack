# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering pinciples,methods nad tools to develop design and maintain high quality software.
software engineering is very important in that it enables creation of software applications that power various aspects of modern life including communication ,commerce,enternment and healthcare that we enjoy today.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ket milestones in the evolution of software engineering include;
develpment of  programming languages (FORTRAN ,C)
recognition of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s





List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements:collecting and documenting user needs and system requirments
design: creating high level and detailed designs for the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a sequential aproach with distinct phases eg. requirments,design,testing, etc while agile methodology focuses on felixibility colaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer;writes code and implements software aplications
quality assurance engineer;ensures quality by designing and implemnting test plans
project manager:oversees planning and delivery of softwares


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
vcs trac changes to source codes  and coordinate work among team members an example is git 
IDEs are software suites that provide tools for writing testing and debugging codes


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines
changing requirements- doing intensive research   during the requiments stage
technicals debt-avoiding shortcuts
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is about crafting qeustions in a such a way to get effective responses from g AIs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt;tell me about electrity
effective prompt: how does electricity work
